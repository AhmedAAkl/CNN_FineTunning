# CNN_FineTunning in keras with pretrained imagenet weights

we will learn how to use state-of-the-art Deep Learning models to solve a Supervised Image Classification problem using our own datasets with/without GPU acceleration

We will be using the pre-trained Deep Neural Nets trained on the ImageNet challenge that are made publicly available in Keras

The pre-trained models we will consider are VGG16, VGG19, Inception-v3, Xception, ResNet50, InceptionResNetv2 and MobileNet. Instead of creating and training deep neural nets from scratch, what if we use the pre-trained weights of these deep neural net architectures (trained on ImageNet dataset) and use it for our own dataset?


# still preparing other models
